DistributedML
=============

A framework for using distributed computing power to perform computations related to machine learning, neural networks, data mining, prediction models,and various other algorithms to solve problems of great magnitude. Machine learning is only limited by the amount of data available, the amount of processing power, and the creativity of the developer. This framework will allow data enthusiast to collaborate to identify a problem, write machine learning modules in the form of plug-ins to solve the problem, and connect with a community of other developers by way of distributed computing techniques as well as parallelism to distribute the workload associated with the specified problem across many computers across the world. This will provide the same super computing processor power that is available to universities and million dollar companies to a group of dedicated individuals with the desire and tenacity to make a difference.
